# Templates
This is a collection of package templates that I use for new projects.

| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| `library-typescript` | Library written in typescript with tests and code coverage. Package can be used from nodejs and can be bundled to run in the browser. |
| `client-webpack-vue` | Web client using webpack and vue. |
